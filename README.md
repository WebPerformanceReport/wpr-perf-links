# WPR Perf Links

**Perf Links** is a curated knowledge dataset used by **WebPerformance Report (WPR)**.

It contains carefully selected links to authoritative resources about web performance and related disciplines, aimed at helping teams understand not only *what* is happening on the web, but *why it matters* and *what to do next*.

This repository represents the **editorial and educational layer** of WebPerformance Report.

## What is Perf Links?

Perf Links is not a random list of bookmarks.

It is a **curated collection of trusted references** covering topics such as:

- Web Performance and Core Web Vitals  
- Browser behavior and rendering  
- Accessibility  
- Security  
- SEO and discoverability  
- Sustainability and responsible web practices  

Each link is selected to be:
- Relevant
- Credible
- Useful over time (evergreen when possible)

The dataset is consumed by WebPerformance Report reports and helps transform raw metrics into **context, learning, and action**.

## How it is used

Perf Links is used inside WebPerformance Report to:

- Enrich automated reports with educational context
- Provide readers with reliable next steps
- Promote a culture of continuous learning around web performance
- Bridge the gap between metrics and decisions

The dataset itself is intentionally **separated from presentation**, allowing it to evolve independently as a knowledge source.

## Curation principles

Perf Links follows a strict editorial approach:

- Quality over quantity  
- Trusted and authoritative sources  
- Clear relevance to web performance and its adjacent disciplines  
- Long-term value over short-lived trends  

This repository is **curated knowledge**, not crowdsourced content.
